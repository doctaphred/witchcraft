witchcraft
==========

Local music directory management utilities.

Purpose
-------

To make it easier to manage the storage and playback of tracks and albums that I
have purchased from various online retailers.

By making it easier to manage my local music library I will be more likely to
purchase music and support the artists that make the music I love.

Implemented
-----------

- metadata database
- ingest a single file
- unpack and ingest bandcamp zipfiles

TODO
----

- add ``play`` entry point and query language for building playlists from the
  metadata db.
- provide overrides for more metadata in the ``ingest`` entry point.
- add more unpackers for different vendors.

Name
----

The name is from the track Witchcraft on the Shinigami EP by Sorrow. No real
reason, just love that song and the name seemed to fit the idea of a query
language for music.
